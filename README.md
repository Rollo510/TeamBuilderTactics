TEAM BUILDER TACTICS JAVASCRIPT PROJECT

TEAM BUILDER TACTICS is a Single Page App that allows users to select and place units from the popular Riot Games game, Team Fight Tactics, on a board and save their positions.  Users can then save those positions under a team name, and recall them later.  Backend API functionality is handled by Ruby on Rails, and Javascript on the frontend.  

Prerequisites: To be safe, you will need the latest version of Ruby and Javascript. The bundler/setup should take care of most of what you need, but to be safe, you'll need to have access to the gems in the bundler.
